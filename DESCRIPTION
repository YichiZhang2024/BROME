Description: This package implements the Bayesian Region of Measurement 
    Equivalence (ROME) framework for visualizing and testing the combined impact 
    of partial invariance on the group difference in observed scores. 
    Under the proposed framework, researchers first compute the highest 
    posterior density intervals (HPDIs)—which contain the most plausible 
    values—for the expected group difference in observed test scores over a 
    range of latent trait levels. By comparing the HPDIs with a predetermined 
    range of values that is practically equivalent to zero (i.e., region of 
    measurement equivalence), researchers can determine whether a test 
    instrument is practically invariant.
